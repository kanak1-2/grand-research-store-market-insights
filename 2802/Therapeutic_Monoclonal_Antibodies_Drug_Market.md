<h1>Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Drug Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (MABs) are a class of biologic drugs designed to target specific molecules in the body, primarily for treating diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. These drugs are engineered to bind to specific proteins or antigens on the surface of cells, disrupting disease progression or enhancing the immune response. Monoclonal antibodies are derived from a single clone of cells, which allows for the creation of drugs that are highly specific to the targeted antigen.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>In the context of oncology, monoclonal antibodies are used to treat various cancers by either marking cancer cells for destruction by the immune system or directly interfering with the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to proliferate. These therapies have revolutionized the treatment of diseases like lymphoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, offering targeted treatment with fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy.</p>
