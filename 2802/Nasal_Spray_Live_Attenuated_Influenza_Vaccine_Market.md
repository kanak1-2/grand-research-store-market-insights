<h1>Nasal Spray Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Nasal Spray Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is a vaccine designed to protect individuals against the influenza virus. Unlike traditional injectable vaccines that contain inactivated virus particles, the LAIV uses a weakened, live version of the influenza virus. This live virus is attenuated, meaning it has been modified to significantly reduce its virulence while maintaining its ability to stimulate the immune system effectively. LAIV is typically administered through the nose, offering an alternative to injectable flu vaccines. FluMist is one of the most recognized brands in this category, gaining popularity due to its ease of use and non-invasive nature.</p>
