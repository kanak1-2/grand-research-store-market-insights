 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Solvent-borne Fire-resistant Coatings is a commonly used construction material in Europe. It is a thin film, but in case of a fire it will expand by 20-50 times creating a thermal barrier and protecting the steel frame from collapsing. The thin coating configulation offers a stylish appearance and design flexibility as well as an ease of application. Its significant advantages allow fire-resistant intumescent coatings to be applied to exposed steel frame surfaces often found in recent architectural styles used for atriums and showrooms where conventional fire-resistant coatings pose many difficulties.</p>
