<h1>Nanotechnology in Targeted Drug Delivery Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Nanoparticle drug delivery systems are highly engineered technologies that utilize nanoparticles for the targeted delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents. These systems aim to improve treatment efficacy by ensuring drugs reach their intended site of action with minimal off-target effects. Unlike traditional drug delivery methods, nanoparticles offer precision in targeting specific cells or tissues, thus reducing side effects and lowering both dosage and frequency of administration. Nanoparticles can be composed of various materials such as lipids, polymers, or metals, and are designed to optimize stability, biocompatibility, and functionality for therapeutic purposes.</p>
