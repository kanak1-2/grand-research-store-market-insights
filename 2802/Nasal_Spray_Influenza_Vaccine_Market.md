<h1>Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The <strong>Nasal Spray Vaccine</strong> refers to a vaccine administered through the nasal route. This type of vaccine is primarily used for influenza prevention and works by delivering antigens directly to the mucous membranes, stimulating an immune response in the respiratory system. This method is especially advantageous due to its non-invasive nature and ability to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity.</p>
