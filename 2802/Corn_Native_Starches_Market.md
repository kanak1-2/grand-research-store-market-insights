<h1>Corn Native Starches Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Corn native starch is a naturally occurring carbohydrate polymer derived from maize (corn). It is widely used in various industries for its texturizing, thickening, and stabilizing properties. Unlike modified starches, native starch remains in its original form without undergoing chemical alteration. The primary components of corn native starch include amylose and amylopectin, which contribute to its gelling and viscosity characteristics. This versatile ingredient finds applications in the food, pharmaceutical, paper, textile, and cosmetic industries, where it enhances texture, consistency, and functionality.</p>
