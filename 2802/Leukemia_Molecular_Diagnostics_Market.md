<h1>Leukemia Molecular Diagnostics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Molecular diagnosis of leukemia is a method of diagnosing and classifying leukemia by detecting specific gene mutations, chromosomal abnormalities or other molecular markers in leukemia patients. This diagnostic technology uses advanced molecular biology tools such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify molecular features in leukemia cells. Molecular diagnosis of leukemia not only helps to diagnose the disease, but also can accurately classify leukemia subtypes, providing an important basis for the formulation of individualized treatment plans. This precise diagnostic method helps to assess the patient&#39;s prognosis, monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and detect the risk of recurrence at an early stage. It is an indispensable tool in modern leukemia management.</p>
