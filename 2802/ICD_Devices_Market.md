 <p>ICD stands for Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator. It&#39;s a device implanted under the skin, typically near the collarbone, to monitor heart rhythms. If it detects dangerous arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), it can deliver electric shocks or pacing to restore normal heart rhythms and prevent sudden cardiac arrest.</p>

 <p>The ICD devices(Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) is a small battery-powered devices implanted in the body that detects and stops irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). The ICD devices continuously monitors the heartbeat and, if needed, delivers an electric shock to restore a normal heart rhythm.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Traditional ICD(Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) is implanted in the chest with wires that run to the heart. Implantation medical procedures require invasive procedures.S-ICD (Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) is a less invasive alternative to a traditional ICD. The S-ICD device is implanted under the skin at the side of the chest below the armpit. It connects it to a sensor that runs along the breastbone.The device only needs to be implanted under the skin, and the wires do not need to go into the heart. This eliminates potentially significant short- and long-term risks associated with placing wires within the heart or blood vessels.</p>
