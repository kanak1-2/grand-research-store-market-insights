 <p><strong>Ethylene and Propylene Cracking Catalysts</strong>: Specialized catalysts used in the petrochemical industry to enhance the production of ethylene and propylene, which are essential building blocks for various plastics, chemicals, and fuels. In a process known as "cracking," these catalysts enable the breakdown of larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller olefins, primarily ethylene and propylene, by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction. Cracking catalysts, often zeolite-based, improve the efficiency, yield, and selectivity of the cracking process, reducing energy consumption and increasing the output of high-demand olefins.</p>
