 <p><strong>Textured Soy Protein Concentrates (TSPC)</strong> are plant-based products derived from soybeans, specifically processed to provide a meat-like texture. They are made by removing most of the fat and carbohydrates from soybeans, leaving behind a concentrated form of protein. The soy protein is then mechanically processed and texturized, often through extrusion or other methods, to create a fibrous structure that mimics the texture of meat.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>TSPC is widely used in vegetarian and vegan food products as a meat substitute due to its high protein content and ability to absorb flavors. It is commonly found in products like meatless burgers, sausages, and other plant-based protein foods. TSPC is known for being a nutritious, cost-effective alternative to animal protein, offering a source of essential amino acids, fiber, and minerals.</p>
