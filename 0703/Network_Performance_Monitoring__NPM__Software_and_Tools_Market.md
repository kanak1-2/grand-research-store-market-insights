<h1>Network Performance Monitoring (NPM) Software and Tools Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Network Performance Monitoring (NPM) refers to the use of software and tools to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of a network, including devices such as servers, workstations, mobile devices, and virtual systems. The goal is to ensure that network traffic flows efficiently and that users experience smooth performance without delays or interruptions. NPM tools and software help network administrators track metrics like bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss, and response time across a network to diagnose issues such as congestion, downtime, and slow speeds. These tools are integral to improving overall network reliability, optimizing traffic flow, and minimizing disruptions.</p>
