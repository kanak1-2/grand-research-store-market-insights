 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Underground tracer wire, also called locating wire, is used extensively to trace and locate underground pipe systems in an accurate manner. The wire is placed alongside pipes during installation in order to leave a marker that helps locate them for safe excavation operations at a later date.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Modern pipe installation often involves the use of non-metallic piping materials, making them difficult to locate using magnetic resonance. By installing underground tracer wire, the work environment is made safer for excavators and property owners when future digging operations are required. Tracer wire is commonly used in various utility industries such as water, sewer, gas, and fiber optics. This wire can also be used in irrigation systems, golf course sprinkler systems, and directional drilling applications.</p>
