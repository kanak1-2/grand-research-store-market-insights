<h1>Global Petlier Solid State Heat Pumps Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Petlier Solid State Heat Pumps is an electrically driven, solid-state heat pump using the Peltier effect: Heat is absorbed or generated at the contact points in addition to Joule heating if an electric current flows through a circuit of two dissimiliar conductors. The direction of the electric current define which contact is heated or cooled. The cooling rate depends on the the electrical current while the direction of the pumped heat can be reversed simply by switching the directon of the electric current.</p>
