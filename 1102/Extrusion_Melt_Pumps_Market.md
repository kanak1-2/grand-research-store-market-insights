<h1>Extrusion Melt Pumps Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Melt pump is a component of the extrusion equipment. The main function of the melt pump is to keep the flow and pressure of the melt flow to the die at a continuous and constant level, which means to precisely control output to the die. Melt pumps consist of two gears, usually driven by a single motor. The extruder fills the gears from the suction side, and the rotating gears discharge the polymer on the other side. By precisely controlling the output of melt it eliminates many of the variables that impact extruder throughput stability.</p>
