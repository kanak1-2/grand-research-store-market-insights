<h1>Global Asphalt (Petroleum) Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Petroleum asphalt is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid that is present in most petroleum crude oils and in some natural deposits. Petroleum crude oil is a complex mixture of a great many different hydrocarbons. Petroleum asphalt is defined as that part of crude oil which is separated from the higher-boiling hydrocarbons in crude oil by precipitation upon the addition of lower-boiling hydrocarbon solvents such as propane, pentane, hexane or petroleum asphalt. The precipitated material consists of asphaltenes which have an average molecular weight of about (800 - 2500 g/mole) and exist in the form of flat sheets of polyaromatic condensed rings with short aliphatic chains.</p>
