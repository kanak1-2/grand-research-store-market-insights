<h1>Dispersion Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Dispersing machines are used in all areas of industry where mixing of liquids or liquids with solids is required. A disperser will generate the shear force necessary to rapidly de-lump powders in a liquid. This de-lumping process is called dispersion. A disperser is a high-powered, low volume pump. Considering its substantially higher horsepower per gallon requirement, a disperser is an inefficient mixer.</p>
