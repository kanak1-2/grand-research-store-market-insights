<h1>Riding Mower Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A riding mower is a type of lawn mower on which the operator is seated, unlike mowers which are pushed or towed.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Riding mowers, which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push mowers and are suitable for large lawns, although commercial riding lawn mowers (such as zero-turn mowers) can be "stand-on" types, and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) mowers are mounted on tractors and are designed for large expanses of grass such as golf courses and municipal parks, although they are ill suited for complex terrain requiring maneuverability.</p>
