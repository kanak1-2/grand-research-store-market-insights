<h1>Inlaying Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Inlaying Machine, or a mounting press machine, is a device used to encapsulate samples for metallographic preparation.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Metallographic specimens are typically "mounted" using a hot compression thermosetting resin. In the past, phenolic thermosetting resins have been used, but modern epoxy is becoming more popular because reduced shrinkage during curing results in a better mount with superior edge retention. A typical mounting cycle will compress the specimen and mounting media to 4,000 psi (28 MPa) and heat to a temperature of 350 ?F (177 ?C). When specimens are very sensitive to temperature, "cold mounts" may be made with a two-part epoxy resin. Mounting a specimen provides a safe, standardized, and ergonomic way by which to hold a sample during the grinding and polishing operations.</p>
