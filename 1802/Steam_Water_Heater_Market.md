<h1>Steam Water Heater Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The steam water heater system consists of two major components: a heat exchanger and a blending valve. The interaction of these two components provides instantaneous and continuous hot water, given a steady supply of steam and inlet water. The heat exchanger has inputs of steam and cold water that enter and stay separate via a coil or pipe system. The thermal difference of the two increases the temperature of the water, which is output to the blending valve. The thermal decline of the steam causes it to condense into water, which is then drained out.</p>
