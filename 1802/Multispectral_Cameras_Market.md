 <p>Multispectral camera enables a range of applications including medical diagnostics, machine vision in process control, and safety and security. It is available in several configurations with resolution. Multispectral cameras capture image data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths may be separated by filters or using instruments which are sensitive to specific wavelengths, including light from frequencies beyond our visible sight, such as infrared. Spectral imaging also allows for extraction of additional information which the human eye fails to capture. Multispectral imaging measures light in a small number (typically 3 to 15) of spectral bands.</p>
