<h1>Vertical Multistage Centrifugal Pump Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>This report studies the Vertical Multistage Centrifugal Pump market, Vertical centrifugal pumps are also referred to as cantilever pumps. They utilize a unique shaft and bearing support configuration that allows the volute to hang in the pump while the bearings are outside the pump. This style of pump uses no stuffing box to seal the shaft but instead utilizes a "throttle bushing". A common application for this style of pump is in a parts washer. A centrifugal pump containing two or more impellers is called a multistage centrifugal pump. The impellers may be mounted on the same shaft or on different shafts.</p>
