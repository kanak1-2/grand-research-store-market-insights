<h1>Green Sand Molding Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries. Green sand indicates the presence of moisture in the molding sand, indicating that the mold has not been baked or dried. The unprocessed sand is mined and then processed to maintain a consistent particle size distribution. When processing and forming, add organoclay to bind the particles together.</p>
