<h1>Automotive Automatic Transmission Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive Automatic Transmission is a device that is connected to the back of the engine and sends the power from the engine to the drive wheels. An automobile engine runs at its best at a certain RPM (Revolutions per Minute) range and it is the transmission&#39;s job to make sure that the power is delivered to the wheels while keeping the engine within that range. It does this through various gear combinations.</p>
