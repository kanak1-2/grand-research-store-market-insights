<h1>Duplicator Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A duplicator is similar to a copier in its basic function: it creates a copy of a document. The catch is that it copies one page at a time and usually in a single color. The output and technology of a duplicator are different than a copier in a few respects. Duplicators don?t use toner and ink; instead, a duplicator creates a stencil and uses thermal imaging to press copies onto pages.</p>
