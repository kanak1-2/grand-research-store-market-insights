<h1>Semiconductor Photolithography Equipment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Semiconductor lithography, also called semiconductor photolithography, is a method of fabrication of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and microprocessors. It transfers a circuit image to a silicon wafer by exposing both silicon wafer and photomask to ultraviolet light and then projects the circuit image on the wafer. The shorter replacement cycles for electronic devices is a key factor driving the market growth.</p>
