<h1>Residential Water Heaters Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Residential water heaters primarily provide hot water for direct use (e.g., in showers and faucets) and for appliances such as dishwashers and clothes washers. There are several types of residential water heaters described below. The most common water heaters in single-family homes are storage tank type water heaters or tankless water heaters.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Storage water heaters use gas (natural gas or propane), electricity or oil to heat and store water at a thermostatically controlled temperature (less than 180? F) for delivery on demand. Federal appliance efficiency standards differentiate storage water heaters based on whether the rated storage volume is greater than 55 gallons or less than or equal to 55 gallons.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Tankless heat water using natural gas, electricity, or propane. These units do not have a tank for storing heated water but instead use a sensor that detects the flow of water over the heat exchanger that initiates the heating element (typical volumes around 0.5 gallons). Instantaneous units are capable of delivering water at a controlled temperature of less than 180?F.</p>
