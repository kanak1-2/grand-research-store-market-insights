<h1>Trash Compactors Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of material such as waste material or bio mass through compaction. A trash compactor is often used by a home or business to reduce the volume of trash. Trash compactors are quite similar to industrial balers, but they are usually used to process non-recyclable materials. The garbage is loaded into the input chamber and subjected to tremendous pressure by a hydraulic or pneumatic press. Once it?s processed, the volume of the waste is greatly reduced, which makes it easier to handle and cheaper to transport, since fewer hauling rounds are required.</p>
