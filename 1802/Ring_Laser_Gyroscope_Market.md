<h1>Ring Laser Gyroscope Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A ring laser <strong>gyroscope</strong> (RLG) consists of a ring laser having two independent counter-propagating resonant modes over the same path; the difference in the frequencies is used to detect rotation. It operates on the principle of the Sagnac effect which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation. Interference between the counter-propagating beams, observed externally, results in motion of the standing wave pattern, and thus indicates rotation.</p>
