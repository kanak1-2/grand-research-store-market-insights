<h1>Train Electro-Mechanical Brake Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A Train Electro-Mechanical Brake refers to magnetic track brake (Mg brake), is a brake for rail vehicles.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>It consists of brake magnets, pole shoes, a suspension, a power transmission and, in the case of mainline railroads, a track rod. When current flows through the magnet coil, the magnet is attracted to the rail, which presses the pole shoes against the rail, thereby decelerating the vehicle.</p>
