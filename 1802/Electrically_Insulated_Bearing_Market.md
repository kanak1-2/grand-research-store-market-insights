<h1>Electrically Insulated Bearing Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Electrically insulated bearings refer to the general term for bearings that can block the passage of current and have insulating properties of the bearing itself. The electric insulating bearing adopts a special spraying process, and the outer surface of the bearing is sprayed with a high-quality coating. The coating has a strong bonding force with the substrate and has good insulation performance, which can prevent the occurrence of current corrosion of the motor shaft. Electrically insulated bearing is a new bearing product that integrates machinery, electrical engineering, materials and other science and technology. Compared with traditional bearings, it increases the insulating function of the bearing itself. This kind of bearing is specially designed to prevent electrolytic corrosion. Long operating life and high reliability. It is widely used in railway locomotive traction main motors, hydropower, thermal power, wind power equipment motors, coal mine machinery motors and other occasions that are susceptible to electric shock or stray current passing through.</p>
