<h1>Radiation Detector Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A radiation detector is a device for measuring nuclear, electromagnetic or light radiation. A nuclear radiation detector identifies nuclear radiation by measuring the emission of ionizing radiation of alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays. Also referred to as a Geiger counter, a nuclear radiation detector consists of two main elements: the processing electronics and the Geiger tube. The Geiger tube is filled with low-pressure inert gas like helium, argon or neon. If radioactive radiation occurs, the inert gas is ionized. An anode within the Geiger tube registers the quantity of ionized particles numerically correlating with the strength of the radioactive radiation. The radioactivity measurement is then displayed on the LCD screen of the Geiger counter or nuclear radiation detector.</p>
