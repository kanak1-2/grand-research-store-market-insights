<h1>Rotary Switches Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A rotary switch is a switch that is operated by turning rather than flipping or pushing. The switches were common in devices that needed to provide a wide array of options rather than the two or three provided by the other switch types. A rotary switch consists of a single pin, called a rotor, which has one or more flat wheels connected to it, called decks. When a user turns a knob, the rotor turns the decks and changes the way they connect to the device. This creates a wide array of different possible settings.</p>
