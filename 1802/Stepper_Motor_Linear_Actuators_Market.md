<h1>Stepper Motor Linear Actuators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A linear actuator is a device that develops a force and a motion through a straight line. A stepper motor-based linear actuator uses a stepping motor as the source of rotary power. Inside the rotor, there?s a threaded precision nut instead of a shaft. The shaft is replaced by a lead-screw. As the rotor turns (as in a conventional stepper motor), linear motion is achieved directly through the nut and threaded screw. It makes sense to accomplish the rotary to linear conversion directly inside the motor, as this approach greatly simplifies the design of rotary to linear applications. This allows high resolution and accuracy ideal for use in applications where precision motion is required.</p>
