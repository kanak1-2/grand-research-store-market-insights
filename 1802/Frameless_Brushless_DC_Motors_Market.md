<h1>Frameless Brushless DC Motors Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Brushless DC electric motor (BLDC motors, BL motors) also known as electronically commutated motors (ECMs, EC motors), or synchronous DC motors, are synchronous motors powered by DC electricity via an inverter or switching power supply which produces an AC electric current to drive each phase of the motor via a closed loop controller. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings that control the speed and torque of the motor.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>For example, in components space and weight are a prime concern, with standard solutions coming up against their limits. For this reason, motor is offering its brushless motors as frameless motor kits. Rotors and stators are delivered separately ? without bearings or motorshaft ? and connected only when the components are assembled. In this way, customers achieve the best of both worlds: high torque density and minimum volume.</p>
