<h1>Plate and Frame Heat Exchangers Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A plate and frame heat exchanger is a type of heat exchanger that uses metal plates to transfer heat between two fluids. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger surface area because the fluids are spread out over the plates. This facilitates the transfer of heat, and greatly increases the speed of the temperature change.</p>
