<h1>Helium Ion Microscopes Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Helium ion microscopy was developed based on gas field ion source (GFIS) technology, and has initially been used primarily for imaging when it was introduced to the market in 2006. Recent development in applications has been shifted to nano fabrication mainly due to its superior probe quality. With a probe size of ?0.5 nanometer, the He ion beam enables nanoscale patterning such as nanopore fabrication with pore size as small as 2 nanometers and line patterning of sub 10 nanometers line width. Compared with focused Ga ion beam, Ne and He gases are inert leaving no chemical contamination in the processed sample.</p>
