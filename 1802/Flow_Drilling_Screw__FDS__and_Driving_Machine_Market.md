<h1>Flow Drilling Screw (FDS) and Driving Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Flow drill screw driving (FDS) is a one?sided thermomechanical assembly process based on heat generation by frictional force and plastic deformation. A special screw, known as hole forming and self-tapping screw, is used in this process as both fastener and tool. Moreover, rotational and translation movements are applied to the screw to create special friction conditions with the workpiece. Furthermore, unlike traditional drilling and thread milling processes, there is no chip or waste of material in FDS and the machining operations are realized through plastic deformation. The report study flow drilling screw (FDS) and the driving machine.</p>
