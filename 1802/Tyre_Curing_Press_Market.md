<h1>Tyre Curing Press Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Tyre Curing Press, (Tire Curing Press in America), is a kind of machine which is used in the vulcanization process of tyre production.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.</p>
