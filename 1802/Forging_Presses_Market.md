<h1>Forging Presses Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Forging is the operation where the metal is heated and then a force is applied to manipulates the metals in such a way that the required final shape is obtained. Forging is generally a hot working process though cold forging is used sometimes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Press forging works by slowly applying a continuous pressure or force, which differs from the near-instantaneous impact of drop-hammer forging. The amount of time the dies are in contact with the work piece is measured in seconds (as compared to the milliseconds of drop-hammer forges). The press forging operation can be done either cold or hot.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The main advantage of press forging, as compared to drop-hammer forging, is its ability to deform the complete work piece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of the work piece in contact with the hammer and anvil; the interior of the work piece will stay relatively unreformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part&#39;s strain rate. We specifically know what kind of strain can be put on the part, because the compression rate of the press forging operation is controlled.</p>
