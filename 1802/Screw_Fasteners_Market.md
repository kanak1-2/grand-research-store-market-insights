<h1>Screw Fasteners Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A screw is a type of fastener, typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread) or just thread. A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a nail. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. A screw will usually have a head on one end that contains a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or driven, with a tool.</p>
