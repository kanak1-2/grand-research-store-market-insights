<h1>Plasma Cutting Torches Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Plasma cutting torches usually use a copper nozzle to constrict the gas stream with the arc flowing through it. That arc jumps from an electrode in the torch to something else ? usually the conductive material being cut. That?s a ?transferred arc?. There are some systems that use a ?non-transferred? arc where it jumps from the electrode back to the nozzle, but those are not usually used for cutting. So that means that plasma cutting is only used for materials that are conductive, primarily mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. But lots of other metals and alloys are conductive too, such as copper, brass, titanium, monel, inconel, cast iron, etc. The problem is that the melting temperature of some of those metals makes them difficult to cut with a good quality edge.</p>
