<h1>Personal Radiation Dosimeter Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The Personal Radiation Dosimeter is of fundamental importance in the disciplines of radiation dosimetry and radiation health physics and is primarily used to estimate the radiation dose deposited in an individual wearing the device. For active type product?the revenue comes from the products sold to customers. For passive dosimetry methods such as TLD,OSL ?RPL, many players in the market earn money not only through the sales of dosimeters but also with service at the same time. For the OSL dosimeters, the products can be reused even for more than 10 years, so <strong>major players</strong> often package products and services for sale. So in this report we measure the market mainly through the products and service revenue segment.</p>
