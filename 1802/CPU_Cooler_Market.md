<h1>CPU Cooler Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>CPU Cooler is required to remove the waste heat produced by CPU, to keep CPU within permissible operating temperature limits.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Computer Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use of heatsinks cooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots. Computer fans are widely used along with heatsinks to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also more exotic cooling techniques, such as liquid cooling.</p>
