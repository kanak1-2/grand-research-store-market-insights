<h1>Fiber Optic Cable Assembly Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Fiber optic cable assemblies consist of an optical fiber, a reinforcement strand for support, and fiber optic connectors.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Fiber Optic Cable is a cable containing one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light. The optical fiber elements are typically individually coated with plastic layers and contained in a protective tube suitable for the environment where the cable will be deployed.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In order for a signal to move from one fiber optic cable to another, the fibers must be secured and properly aligned with the connecting cable fibers. The type of connector depends upon the type of optical fiber and intended assembly function. Some major types of connectors include ST, FC, LC, MT-RJ, SC, and MU connectors.</p>
