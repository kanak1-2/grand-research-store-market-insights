<h1>Agriculture Sprayer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>While sprayers were once a niche product, today sprayers have become an essential piece of farm equipment for effective crop production. By properly applying chemicals to control weeds, insects, and diseases, you give your crop the best chance for high yields. The uptick in self-propelled sprayer ownership started in 2005 when there was an increase in Asian soybean rust and farmers needed to have a sprayer available to make timely fungicide applications. Guidance systems and advanced controls have also made sprayers much easier to operate, contributing to the acceleration of on-farm sprayers.</p>
