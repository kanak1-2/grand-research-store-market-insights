<h1>Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Transmission electron <strong>microscope</strong> (TEM) is an imaging technology in which electron beams pass through very thinly sectioned specimens, and field emission refers to the phenomenon that electrons are released from the surface of the cathode under the action of a strong electric field, which belongs to cold cathode emission. As the electrons are transmitted through the specimen and interact with its structure, an image resolves that is magnified and focused onto an imaging medium, such as photographic film or a fluorescent screen, or captured by a special CCD camera. Because the electrons used in transmission electron <strong>microscope</strong> have a very small wavelength, TEMs can image at much higher resolutions than conventional optical <strong>microscopes</strong> that depend on light beams. Due to their higher resolving power, TEMs play an important role in the fields of virology, cancer research, the study of materials, and in microelectronics research and development.</p>
