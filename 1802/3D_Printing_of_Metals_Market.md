<h1>3D Printing of Metals Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Metal 3D printer, also called metal additive manufacturing, can produce metallic products through three - dimensional and printing technology. Now it is widely used in automotive industry, aerospace industry and medical industry. Metal 3D printer works by laying down metal powder. A high powered laser then melts that powder in certain precise locations based on a CAD file. Once one layer is melted, the printer will place another layer of metal powder on top, and the process repeats until an entire object is fabricated.</p>
