<h1>Plastic Injection Molding Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>An Injection molding machine, also known as an injection press, is a machine for manufacturing plastic products by the injection molding process. It consists of two main parts, an injection unit and a clamping unit.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Machines are classified primarily by the type of driving systems: hydraulic, electric, or hybrid.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Instead of being driven by a hydraulic system, all-electric machines use digitally controlled, high speed and highly efficient servo motors to drive the whole process. Each axis is controlled by an independent motor for injection, extruder, clamping and ejection.</p>
