<h1>Turbocompressor Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine&#39;s efficiency and power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber. This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine&#39;s power output is due to the fact that the compressor can force more air?and proportionately more fuel?into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Turbochargers were originally known as turbo super chargers when all forced induction devices were classified as superchargers. Nowadays the term "supercharger" is usually applied only to mechanically driven forced induction devices. The key difference between a turbocharger and a conventional supercharger is that a supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine, often through a belt connected to the crankshaft, whereas a turbocharger is powered by a turbine driven by the engine&#39;s exhaust gas. Compared to a mechanically driven supercharger, turbochargers tend to be more efficient, but less responsive. Twincharger refers to an engine with both a supercharger and a turbocharger.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Turbochargers are commonly used on train, aircraft, and construction equipment engines. They are most often used with Otto cycle and Diesel cycle internal combustion engines. They have also been found useful in automotive fuel cells.</p>
