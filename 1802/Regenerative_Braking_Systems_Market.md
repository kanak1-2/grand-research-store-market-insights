<h1>Regenerative Braking Systems Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Regenerative braking system (RBS) is a mechanism that uses a generator to recover kinetic energy while braking. In conventional vehicles, most of the kinetic energy generated during braking is converted into heat and is dissipated into the environment. RBS helps in converting the generated heat into electrical energy and further store it in an energy storage system such as flywheel, batteries, and ultra-capacitors.</p>
