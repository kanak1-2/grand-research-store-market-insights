<h1>Ultrasonic Non-destructive Test Equipment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Non-destructive Test Equipment (NDT) identifies coating thickness, wall thickness, defects, corrosion, spot welds and other weaknesses in industrial equipment as well as bridges, pipes, buildings, furniture, etc. It is also can be used for composites, hardness, leak detection etc.Ultrasonic testing (UT) is a form of non-destructive testing (NDT) that uses high-frequency sound waves to characterize the thickness or internal structure of a given sample. The frequencies used for UT are usually in the range of 500 kHz to 20 Mhz.As a NDT method, UT is ideal for detecting defects, flaws, and welds. Regular UT inspections are also ideal for checking existing equipment, such as piping, for corrosion and are therefore an integral part of any predictive maintenance program.</p>
