 <p>A cycloidal gear profile is toothed gear that is based on the epicycloid and hypocycloid curves, which describe the curves created by a circle rolling around the inside and the outside of another circle correspondingly. Cycloidal gears are different from conventional gears because they operate without high speed gear teeth and their components operate in compression.</p>
