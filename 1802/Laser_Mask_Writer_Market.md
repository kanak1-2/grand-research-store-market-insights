<h1>Laser Mask Writer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Laser Mask Writer is used for photomask manufacturing, it is a maskless lithography systems useing laser source. Compared with Mask writers based on electron-beam (e-beam) technology,mask makers prefer to use faster laser-based systems wherever possible, including for all but the most critical masks for advanced devices. Laser writers are also widely used to overlay second level patterns on already-patterned masks, a requirement to produce phase-shifting masks (PSMs) that enhance the process window for wafer lithography.</p>
