<h1>Laser Triangulation Sensors Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Laser triangulation sensors can be divided into two categories based upon their performance and intended use. High-resolution lasers are typically used in displacement and position monitoring applications where high accuracy, stability and low temperature drift are required. Quite frequently these laser sensors are used in process monitoring and closed-loop feedback control systems. Proximity type laser triangulation sensors are much less expensive and are typically used to detect the presence of a part or used in counting applications.</p>
