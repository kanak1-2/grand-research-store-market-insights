 <p>Laser welding finned tube is processed by laser welding machine. Laser welding is a welding method that irradiates a high-intensity laser beam onto the metal surface. Through the interaction of the laser and the metal, the metal absorbs the laser light and converts it into heat, melting the metal to form a cooling crystal. Because the welding process is fully automatic and mechanical, the scientific and technological content and quality of laser welding finned tubes are superior to traditional cooling tubes.</p>
