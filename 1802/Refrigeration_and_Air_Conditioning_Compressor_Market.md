<h1>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Compressor Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Refrigerant Compressors are driven fluid machines enhance a high-pressure gas from low-pressure gas. It is the heart of the refrigeration system. It sucked in from the suction pipe temperature low-pressure refrigerant gas, through motor driven piston compressor to exhaust high temperature and pressure refrigerant gas to provide power for the refrigeration cycle, in order to achieve compression ? condensation (exothermic ) ? expansion ? evaporation (heat absorption) of the refrigeration cycle.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Air Compressor is a device that converts power (usually from an electric motor, a diesel engine or a gasoline engine) into kinetic energy by compressing and pressurizing air. The energy in the compressed air can be stored while the air remains pressurized. The energy can be used for a variety of applications, usually by utilizing the kinetic energy of the air as it is depressurized.</p>
