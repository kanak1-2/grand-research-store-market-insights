<h1>Elevator Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>An Elevator, also called Lift in British English, is a type of transport equipment that efficiently carries passengers or freight between the levels of multistory building. Most modern elevators are propelled by electric motors, with the aid of a counterweight, through a system of cables and sheaves (pulleys). By opening the way to higher buildings, the elevator played a decisive role in creating the characteristic urban geography of many modern cities, especially in the United States, and promises to fill an indispensable role in future city development.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In generally, elevators include the escalators and the moving walkways. An escalator is a moving staircase used as transportation between floors or levels in subways, buildings, and other mass pedestrian areas.

The different between the escalator and the moving walkway is the former has stairs and the latter is a flat or slant apron without stairs.</p>
