<h1>Segmented Ball Valves Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A segmented ball valve is similar to a conventional ball valve, but with a contoured V-notch segment in the ball. This control valve has good range ability, control, and shutoff capability. The V-notch ball provides positive shearing action and produces an inherent equal percentage flow characteristic. It provides non-clogging, high capacity flow control. The V-notch ball has been specially contoured to maximize capacity and enhance seal life and shutoff integrity.</p>
