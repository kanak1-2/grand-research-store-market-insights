 <p>Laboratory Digestion System is a device for digestion treatment. In the determination of inorganic elements in environmental samples (water samples, soil samples, solid waste and particulate matter intercepted during atmospheric sampling, etc.), the environmental samples need to be digested. The function of the digestion treatment is to destroy organic matter, dissolve particulate matter, and oxidize various valence states to be measured into a single high valence state or convert it into easily decomposable inorganic compounds.</p>
