 Near-Eye Displays (NED), also known as head-mounted displays (HMD) or wearable displays, are technology systems that project a virtual image into the viewer's field of vision. These displays utilize a combination of small panels and optics to create a visual experience that appears at a distance, resembling how objects appear in the real world, even though the actual display panel is typically much smaller. NEDs are used in various applications including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), medical imaging, and entertainment, providing a more immersive and interactive experience for the user. This market encompasses both AR and VR devices, with further segmentation based on their use in different industries and applications.
