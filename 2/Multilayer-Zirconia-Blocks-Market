 Multilayer zirconia blocks are advanced dental ceramics composed of multiple layers of zirconia, each featuring a different shade and translucency. This layered structure allows for the fabrication of natural-looking dental restorations, closely mimicking the color gradient and translucency of real teeth. These blocks are primarily manufactured using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. The process begins with scanning a patient's teeth to create a digital model, which is then used to design the restoration. Once the design is finalized, it is milled from a multilayer zirconia block, ensuring precision and efficiency in dental applications.
