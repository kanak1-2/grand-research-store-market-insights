<h1>Non-Ionic Surfactants Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Non-ionic surfactants are surface-active agents that do not carry an electrical charge. Unlike ionic surfactants, they rely on the molecular structure rather than electrical charges to reduce surface tension. This unique characteristic makes them highly versatile and compatible with a variety of applications, including detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. They are especially valued for their mildness, excellent emulsification properties, and stability in hard water.</p>
