<h1>Ultra-pasteurized Cream Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Ultra-pasteurized creams are subject to an ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurization process where they are heated to at least 275????F for a very short period of time. Ultra pasteurized dairy products (the process is used for many products, including juices, etc.) have a much longer shelf life than their pasteurized counterparts because the process eliminates a much larger percentage of bacteria than regular pasteurization does.</p>
