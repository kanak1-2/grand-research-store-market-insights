<h1>Nonionic Surfactants and Wetting Agents Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Nonionic surfactants and wetting agents are surface-active compounds that lack an electrical charge in their hydrophilic heads. These agents are valued for their versatility and are widely used in various applications, including detergents, pesticides, coatings, textiles, and industrial processes. They reduce surface tension, enhance spreading, and improve the wetting properties of liquids, making them indispensable in many industries.</p>
