<h1>Nonprotein Nitrogen (NPN) Supplements (Animal Feeds) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>All proteins contain nitrogen, but not all nitrogen is contained in proteins. Nitrogen-based compounds other than natural protein are commonly referred to as non-protein nitrogen (NPN) sources. Beef cattle have the ability to use natural protein or some NPN to meet their protein requirements. Non-protein nitrogen sources do not contain amino acids, and thus are not considered to be natural (i.e., true) protein. However, rumen microbes have the ability to convert NPN to protein in the presence of an adequate energy source. Common NPN sources include urea and biuret.</p>
