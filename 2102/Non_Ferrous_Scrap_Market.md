<h1>Non-Ferrous Scrap Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Non-ferrous metal scrap recycling refers to the process of recycling, purifying and reusing scrap or expired materials containing precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium and other non-ferrous metals (such as copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, nickel, etc.) through professional institutions and professional technologies. Non-ferrous metal scrap refers to materials that have completed their service life or no longer meet the original use requirements during the production and consumption of non-ferrous metals and their alloy products. These scraps include scraps, cut heads, tails, waste products in the production process, and non-ferrous metal parts and materials discarded after consumption. Non-ferrous metal scraps can be re-refined into non-ferrous metals or their alloys through recycling, classification, pretreatment and smelting processes. This process is called recycled non-ferrous metal production. Recycled non-ferrous metals are similar to primary metals in performance, but the energy consumption and pollution in the production process are much lower than those of primary metal production, so they have important environmental and economic benefits.</p>
