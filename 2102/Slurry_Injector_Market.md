 <p>Slurry injecting is the process of grinding solids, in this case, manure, into small particles which can then be combined with water or an alternative fluid, to create a slurry consistency, which can then be injected. The slurry product is injected into the ground and can stimulate boosted production of crops. Slurry injection can allow more nitrogen to be introduced into the soil, but, as with all manure application processes, farmers must measure and gauge the mineral levels within their soils ahead of applying or injecting any further fertilisers. Slurry injection has become a favoured process of application in recent years, due to its reduced ammonia emission (around 70% reduction), which can preserve Nitrogen, reduce odour complaints and overall provide a more cost-effective agricultural service solution.</p>
