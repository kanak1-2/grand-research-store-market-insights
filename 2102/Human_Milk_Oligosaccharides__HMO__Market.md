<h1>Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycan?s that are found in and unique to human breast milk, despite not actually being digestible by human infants. HMOs function as a prebiotic helping to establish commensal bacteria. HMOs also function as anti-adhesives that help prevent the attachment of microbial pathogens to mucosal surfaces. Human milk oligosaccharides are manufactured through numerous processes which involve the use of several chemicals, enzymes or microbes. The technology used for manufacturing of human milk oligosaccharides is very complex and expensive, thus restricting their large-scale production. <strong>Major players</strong> have been increasing investing increasingly on R&D for low-cost production and the introduction of effective technologies for product synthesis.</p>
