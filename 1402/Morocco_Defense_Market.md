 <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>"Morocco Defense Market - Attractiveness, Competitive Landscape and Forecasts to 2026", report provides an overview of the Morocco defense market, outlining future programs and predicted expenditures. Over the historic period, defense expenditure has been driven by the ongoing rivalry with neighbouring Algeria, the conflict in Western Sahara, and security concerns related to both the drugs trade and terrorism. During 2017-2021, Morocco&#39;s defense expenditure grew at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 8.67% to reach US$6.5 billion in 2021. Whilst persistent geopolitical drivers necessitate continued spending, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are expected to dampen the rate of defense expenditure growth over the forecast period. However, major procurement programs such as the F-16, AH-64, and Avante-class offshore patrol vessel (OPV) will sustain expenditure growth in this period.</p>
