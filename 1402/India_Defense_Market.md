 <p>The Indian defense modernization programs have historically been fueled by the need to maintain a robust deterrence capability to dissuade hostile countries from threatening its sovereign territory. Indian territorial disputes with neighboring China and Pakistan have continued to spur defense spending over the historic period. Having fought armed conflicts with China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965, 1971, and 1999 India has been compelled to maintain robust defense posture to discourage adversaries from engaging in military campaigns. Indian defense expenditure including pensions increased from US$58.3 billion in 2021 to US$63.4 billion in 2021, recording a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.12%. The sluggish growth registered over the historic period is a reflection of economic constraints which have impacted resource availability due to erosion in currency exchange rates. However, with the Indian economy showing signs of recovery the country&#39;s defense expenditure is anticipated to increase from US$69.6 billion in 2022 to US$82.1 billion in 2026, reflecting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.21%.</p>
