 <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global military rotorcraft market is valued at US$21.8 billion in 2021. The cumulative market for global military rotorcraft is estimated at US$253.1 billion over the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to garner a share of 30.2% of the total global military aircraft market during 2021-2031. Countries such as India and China are contributing in significant terms to the growth of the military rotorcraft market in this region. The market is anticipated to be driven by the ongoing global turmoil, internal and external security threats, fleet replacement programs, modernization strategies, and territorial disputes around the world. Apart from emerging economies in the Middle East and South Asian regions which are witnessing increasing defense expenditure due to regional power struggles and territorial disputes, countries in North America and Western Europe are also expected to increase their defense outlays after years of budget cuts and sequestration measures, presenting global military aircraft manufacturers with greater opportunities in the coming decade.</p>
