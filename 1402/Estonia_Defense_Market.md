 <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>"Estonia Defense Market - Attractiveness, Competitive Landscape and Forecasts to 2026", report provides an overview of the Estonian defense market, outlining future programs and predicted expenditures. The defense budget of Estonia reached US$787 million in FY2021, the highest budget submitted and accepted over the historic period. Whilst small in comparison to many of its international allies, this budget is still over the 2% GDP NATO target which many of Estonia&#39;s peers fail to reach or maintain. As such, this modest budget allows Estonia to continue international cooperation and alliances by boosting positive sentiment and demonstrating a commitment to national and collective security. This is especially important in the face of Russia&#39;s looming presence.</p>
