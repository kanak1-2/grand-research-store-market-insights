 <p>During the historic period, increasing defense expenditure has mainly been driven by its NATO obligations, and the persistent threat of Russia. Over 2017-2021, Bulgaria&#39;s defense expenditure increased at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 15.27%, growing from US$0.7 billion in 2017 to US$1.3 billion in 2021. Throughout 2017-2026, there is not expected to be any decline in the annual defense budget. This is largely driven by Bulgaria&#39;s commitment to attaining the 2.0% of GDP target set by NATO. Bulgaria has produced a spending plan which will enable the country to reach this target in 2024, with an increasing proportion of GDP being spent on defense annually leading up to 2024.</p>

 <p>Over the forecast period, defense expenditure is anticipated to increase from US$1.4 billion in 2022 to US2.1 billion in 2026, reflecting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 10.58%. This defense expenditure is driven by the security threat posed by Russia, as well as the need to reach the 2% of GDP spent on defense requested by NATO allies. The defense budget as a percentage of GDP is expected to grow steadily from 1.2% in 2017 to 2.0% in 2024. Once this threshold has been reached, defense spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to stabilise at around the 2% mark in 2025 and 2026. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen in the declining rate of budget growth over the forecast period, falling from 14.9% in 2021 to 9.6% in 2022.</p>

 <p>- Russia as primary threat</p>
