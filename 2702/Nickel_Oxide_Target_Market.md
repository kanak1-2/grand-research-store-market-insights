<h1>Nickel Oxide Target Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Nickel Oxide Target is a material that is used to create a thin layer in a technique called as sputter deposition or film deposition. While carrying out this process, the target material which starts as a solid is further broken by gaseous ions in small particles which is used to coat or spray any substrate or surface. This is generally used to create semiconductor and computer chips and hence target materials are generally metallic elements or alloys.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Nickel Oxide Target market size was estimated at USD 1693 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 2836.09 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.90% during the forecast period.</p>
