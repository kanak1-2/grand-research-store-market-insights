<h1>Moexipril Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Moexipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that plays a critical role in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure. It works by inhibiting the enzyme that constricts blood vessels, thereby relaxing them and improving blood flow. By managing blood pressure and heart function, Moexipril helps reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney problems. The global Moexipril market includes the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of this drug, catering to individuals suffering from cardiovascular diseases.</p>
