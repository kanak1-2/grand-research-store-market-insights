<h1>Micro-single Camera Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>A micro-single camera, often referred to as a mirrorless camera, is a type of digital camera that incorporates the ability to change lenses but does not have a mirror reflex mechanism, unlike traditional digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. This category of cameras is known for being smaller, lighter, and more compact than DSLR cameras while still offering high-quality imaging capabilities. The term "micro" refers to the smaller size of the camera compared to a typical DSLR, while "single" highlights the fact that these cameras have a single, interchangeable lens. The popularity of micro-single cameras has surged in recent years due to their versatility, portability, and high-quality performance, making them a favorite among both professional photographers and hobbyists.</p>
