<h1>Micro-RNA Sequencing and Assay Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">MicroRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) is a specialized form of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) that employs next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze microRNAs (miRNAs). These short, non-coding RNA molecules play crucial roles in gene regulation. Unlike conventional RNA-seq, miRNA-seq is optimized to enrich small RNA fragments, enabling researchers to study miRNA expression patterns, discover novel miRNAs, and analyze disease-related miRNA dysregulation. Given its significance in disease diagnostics, particularly in oncology, miRNA-seq is increasingly becoming an essential tool in molecular research and clinical applications.</p>
