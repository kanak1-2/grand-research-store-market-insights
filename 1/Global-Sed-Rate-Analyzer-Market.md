A Sed Rate Analyzer is a medical device used to measure the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is a blood test that indirectly measures the level of inflammation in the body. The analyzer determines how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle at the bottom of a test tube over a specified period. A higher sedimentation rate can indicate the presence of inflammation, infection, or certain diseases, such as autoimmune disorders or infections. The Sed Rate Analyzer automates the process, improving accuracy, efficiency, and consistency compared to traditional manual methods.



The global Sed Rate Analyzer market is experiencing moderate growth, driven by clinical diagnostics automation and healthcare efficiency requirements. In 2023, total installations reached 42,000 units, with clinical laboratories accounting for 55% of demand. The high-throughput segment is the fastest-growing at 6.8% annually. The market saw an 18% increase in demand for compact systems in 2023, particularly in small laboratories. Automated analyzers dominate with a 70% market share, while manual methods are declining at 5% annually. North America leads with a 38% market share, while Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region at 6.5% CAGR. The industry is focusing on developing POC testing capabilities, with a 22% growth in R&D investments for rapid testing solutions.
