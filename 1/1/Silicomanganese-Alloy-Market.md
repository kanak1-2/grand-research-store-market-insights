Silicomanganese Alloy is a ferroalloy composed primarily of manganese (60-70%), silicon (15-30%), and a small percentage of carbon. It is primarily used in steel production as a deoxidizer and alloying agent to improve the strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance of steel. The silicon content also enhances the steel’s ductility and resistance to oxidation. Silicomanganese is produced in submerged arc furnaces by reducing manganese ore with coke in the presence of quartz to introduce silicon.



The global Silicomanganese Alloy market is experiencing moderate growth, driven by steel industry demand and infrastructure development. In 2023, total production reached 18 million metric tons, with steel manufacturing accounting for 75% of consumption. The high-grade segment is the fastest-growing at 6.2% annually. The market saw a 15% increase in demand for refined grades in 2023, particularly in special steel applications. Standard grade dominates with a 70% market share, while refined grades are growing at 5.5% annually. Asia Pacific leads with a 55% market share, primarily due to Chinese production and consumption, while India is the fastest-growing region at 6.5% CAGR. The industry is focusing on developing energy-efficient production methods, with a 20% growth in R&D investments for process optimization.







Report Overview

Silico manganese which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is ferroalloy composed of manganese, silicon and iron, produced by smelting manganese ore, manganese slag, and coke and quartz flux on high temperature. Mainly silicomanganese contains smaller proportion of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Manganese and silicon are crucial components in steelmaking. As deoxidizers and desulfurizers they improve mechanical properties of steel.
