 <p>Microplate instruments are specialized laboratory tools used to handle and analyze microplates or microtiter plates. These plates are flat vessels with multiple wells, typically used for conducting various types of laboratory tests, especially in biomedical and chemical research. Microplates are commonly utilized in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which are pivotal in diagnostic laboratories for detecting and quantifying substances such as proteins, antibodies, and hormones.</p>

 <p>Microplate instruments include devices that interact with these plates in various ways, such as reading results (microplate readers), dispensing liquids (microplate dispensers), washing wells (microplate washers), and incubating samples (microplate incubators). The most popular microplate format is the 96-well plate, although other variations, such as 6, 24, 384, and 1536-well formats, are also available. The versatility and efficiency of microplate instruments make them indispensable in diagnostic, academic, pharmaceutical, and research laboratory settings.</p>
