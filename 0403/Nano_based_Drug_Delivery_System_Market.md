<h1>Nano based Drug Delivery System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Nanoparticle drug delivery systems are advanced engineered technologies that employ nanoparticles for the precise delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents. These systems aim to minimize side effects, reduce dosage frequency, and enhance treatment efficacy. Nanoparticles, due to their small size and unique properties, allow drugs to be targeted to specific cells or tissues, improving the overall therapeutic outcome. They have emerged as a revolutionary tool in modern medicine, particularly for conditions that require localized treatment or have challenging delivery pathways, such as cancer and neurological disorders.</p>
