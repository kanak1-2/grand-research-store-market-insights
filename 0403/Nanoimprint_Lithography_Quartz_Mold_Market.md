 <p>Nanoimprint lithography can be defined as the use of a mold to define nanoscale deformation of a resist, which is then cured either by heat or UV application. Quartz molds are mainly used in the UV nanoimprint method. quartz is used as the material for semiconductor photomasks. It is characterized by high rigidity and flatness. The manufacturing process, same as that of semiconductor photomask</p>
