 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Enterprise MLC (eMLC) is a type of multi-level cell (MLC) flash that has been enhanced to accommodate more write cycles than consumer-grade MLC flash offers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Individual consumer MLC cells can only provide 3,000 to 10,000 write cycles, while enterprise MLC cells can handle 20,000 to 30,000 write cycles. In the enterprise, eMLC can serve as a compromise between inexpensive MLC flash and very expensive single-level cell (SLC) flash.</p>
