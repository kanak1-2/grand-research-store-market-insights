<h1>Biodegradable Microneedle Patch Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Biodegradable microneedle patches are a revolutionary method for transdermal drug delivery, offering a painless and efficient way to deliver macromolecules, such as drugs and genes, through the skin. Unlike traditional hypodermic needles, these patches use small microneedles that dissolve under the skin, allowing for the gradual release of therapeutic agents. The biodegradable nature of these microneedles ensures that they do not require removal, as they dissolve into the skin, leaving minimal residue. This delivery method is increasingly being utilized for local therapeutic gene delivery, chronic disease treatments, and vaccine administration. The microneedle patches promise several benefits, including enhanced drug efficacy, faster delivery times, and the ability to customize dosages.</p>
