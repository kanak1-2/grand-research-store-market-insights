 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Single Tube Vortex Mixer is a laboratory instrument that is used for mixing small volumes of liquids in a single container. The mixer consists of a motor base that supports a cup or platform that holds a single tube. The motor base creates a rapid swirling or vortex motion of the liquid in the tube by rotating an eccentric weight. This movement creates a homogeneous mixing effect, without introducing aeration or frothing.Single Tube Vortex Mixers are suitable for a wide range of applications, such as dissolving, suspending, and mixing reagents in tubes and vials used in genetic analysis, medical research, and life science applications. The mixer is particularly useful when working with small volumes, allowing for quick and efficient mixing, as well as saving time by eliminating the need for manual mixing.Single Tube Vortex Mixers are commonly used in molecular biology and biochemistry labs to perform tasks such as DNA extraction from tissues or cells, resuspension of sedimented samples, and mixing of viscous reagents.</p>
