 <p>Light Reflective Film is a material designed to reflect light effectively, enhancing illumination and energy efficiency in various applications. Made from polymers like polyester or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with a reflective coating such as aluminum, these films redirect light, reducing the need for additional lighting in settings like agriculture, interior design, automotive, and advertising. In grow rooms, for example, reflective films help maximize light exposure for plants. They are also used in electronics and display technology to improve screen brightness and clarity, contributing to energy savings and optimal light distribution.</p>
