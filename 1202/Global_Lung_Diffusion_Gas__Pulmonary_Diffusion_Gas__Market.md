 <p>Lung Diffusion Gas, also known as Pulmonary Diffusion Gas, is a specialized gas mixture used in medical diagnostics to measure the lung&#39;s ability to transfer gases, particularly oxygen, into the bloodstream. Typically composed of a small amount of carbon monoxide (CO) mixed with an inert gas like helium (He) or neon (Ne), this gas mixture is inhaled by the patient during a pulmonary function test called the "diffusing capacity test" (DLCO test). The test helps assess lung health, diagnose conditions like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and other respiratory disorders, and evaluate the efficiency of gas exchange in the alveoli.</p>
