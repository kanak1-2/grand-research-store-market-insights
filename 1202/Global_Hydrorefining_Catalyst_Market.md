 <p><strong>Hydrorefining Catalyst</strong>: A catalyst used in the hydrorefining process, which is a refining technique in the petroleum industry designed to remove impurities such as sulfur, nitrogen, and metals from crude oil fractions. Hydrorefining involves the use of hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures, and the catalyst facilitates the chemical reactions that improve the quality of the refined products. The hydrorefining catalyst typically consists of metal catalysts (such as nickel, molybdenum, or tungsten) supported on a porous material, often alumina. This process results in cleaner, higher-quality fuels, including low-sulfur gasoline and diesel, which comply with environmental standards.</p>
