 <p><span style="font-size:14px">A <strong>silicone mold release agent</strong> is a silicone-based lubricant applied to molds or surfaces to prevent materials from sticking during manufacturing processes. This agent creates a thin, non-stick layer that allows for easy demolding of products made from materials like plastics, rubber, resins, and composites. Commonly used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, consumer goods, and medical manufacturing, silicone mold release agents are valued for their durability, heat resistance, and ease of application. However, they may leave residues that could impact post-production processes like painting or bonding, so alternative release agents are sometimes used when such processes are required.</span></p>
