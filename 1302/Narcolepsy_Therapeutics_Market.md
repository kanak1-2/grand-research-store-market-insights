<h1>Narcolepsy Therapeutics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that disrupts the body&#39;s ability to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. People suffering from narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and may experience sudden episodes of sleep, ranging from seconds to several hours. Narcolepsy can cause serious challenges in daily life and may also be accompanied by cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone) and other symptoms such as sleep paralysis and vivid dreams.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Narcolepsy therapeutics encompass a wide range of treatments aimed at alleviating the symptoms of this disorder, improving sleep quality, and enhancing the patient&#39;s quality of life. These treatments include pharmaceutical interventions, such as central nervous system stimulants, sodium oxybate, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
