<h1>Natural Dental Bone Graft Substitutes Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Natural dental bone graft substitutes are biomaterials derived from natural sources that are used to replace or regenerate bone tissue in dental procedures. These substitutes are primarily used when patients need bone augmentation in the jaw, typically for dental implants, bone defects due to periodontal disease, or bone loss from trauma. Bone graft substitutes play a crucial role in the field of dental surgery, providing structural support and stimulating the healing process.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>In dental implantology, bone grafting is an essential procedure for patients who do not have sufficient bone volume or density in the jaw to support implants. The use of natural dental bone graft substitutes allows for the promotion of bone growth and the eventual integration of dental implants. These materials are categorized into several types, including allograft bone, xenograft bone, demineralized bone matrix (DBM), and other biologically-derived materials. These substitutes come from human, animal, or synthetic origins and are chosen based on their compatibility, efficacy, and safety profiles.</p>
