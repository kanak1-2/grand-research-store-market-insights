<h1>Ophthalmic Ultrasound Imaging System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>Ophthalmic ultrasound imaging, often referred to as ocular echography or B-scan, is a non-invasive and efficient diagnostic procedure that provides detailed images of the internal structure of the eye. By using sound waves to produce these images, it helps in detecting a variety of ocular conditions, such as retinal disorders, tumors, and cataracts. This diagnostic technology is integral in ophthalmology for both preoperative evaluations and monitoring conditions that might require surgical intervention.</p>
