 <p>Omics is a term summarizing different comprehensive molecular analyses, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics. Transcriptomics for example does not only analyze the expression of a single gene, but investigates the expression pattern of many or even all genes. Omics analyses have been performed across whole tissues or organs. Today, with emerging technologies in single cell isolation and more sensitive molecular technologies, omics analyses can also be conducted at single cells resolution. These so called single cell omics analyses are providing unique insights into the heterogeneity of cells across tissues.</p>
