<h1>Natural Desiccated Thyroid (NDT) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Natural desiccated thyroid (NDT), also known as desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) or porcine thyroid, is a prescription medication derived from the dried thyroid glands of pigs. This medication is used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. NDT contains a mixture of thyroid hormones, primarily T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), along with lesser amounts of T1 and T2, co-factors found in thyroid tissue that may contribute to the effectiveness of the medication. Unlike synthetic thyroid treatments such as levothyroxine (T4) or liothyronine (T3), which are made in laboratories, NDT provides a natural alternative, containing the full spectrum of thyroid hormones.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>NDT is typically administered in tablet form, and it is used as a hormone replacement therapy for individuals who experience symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cognitive issues, and other effects due to low thyroid hormone levels. By restoring the levels of thyroid hormones, NDT helps to regulate various bodily functions and improve overall health.</p>
