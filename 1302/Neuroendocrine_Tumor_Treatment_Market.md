<h1>Neuroendocrine Tumor Treatment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a type of cancer originating from cells that possess both endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system traits. These cells are found throughout the body, but NETs are most commonly observed in the gastrointestinal system, particularly the small intestine, where they are referred to as carcinoid tumors. Other areas where NETs may occur include the pancreas, lungs, and less frequently, other parts of the body.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>NETs can either be benign or malignant, with the malignant forms being particularly dangerous due to their ability to spread to other parts of the body. Treatment options depend on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. These tumors can sometimes release hormones that cause a range of symptoms, known as carcinoid syndrome, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment.</p>
