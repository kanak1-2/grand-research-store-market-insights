<h1>Natriuretic Peptide Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Natriuretic peptides are a group of hormones predominantly produced by the heart in response to increased blood volume and pressure. These peptides, including A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), play a vital role in regulating cardiovascular function. Their primary function is to help the body maintain fluid balance and regulate blood pressure by promoting natriuresis (the excretion of sodium through urine), vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), and inhibiting the production of renin and aldosterone. In essence, natriuretic peptides counteract the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the strain on the heart.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>These hormones are important markers in diagnosing heart failure and assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, they are often utilized in medical diagnostics, particularly in assays for the detection of abnormal natriuretic peptide levels in patients.</p>
