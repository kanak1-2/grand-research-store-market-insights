 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Silt Density Index (SDI) Test Kit is a laboratory instrument used to determine the level of suspended solids in water. The SDI Test Kit consists of a test stand, graduated cylinders, funnels, tubing, and filters. The test is conducted by taking a water sample and passing it through a membrane filter. The filter is then evaluated for any blockages or fouling. The SDI value is then calculated and used to determine the suitability of the water for use in industrial processes and applications.</p>
