<h1>Neuro Rehabilitation Portable Device Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>The Neuro Rehabilitation Portable Device market revolves around medical devices used for neurological rehabilitation, particularly for individuals recovering from neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and other neurological disorders. These devices combine a variety of technologies including electric stimulation, surface electromyography (SEMG), and gaming-based activities to help individuals regain muscle strength, improve motor skills, and enhance neuroplasticity.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>The system often involves electric stimulation of muscles to induce contractions and facilitate motor recovery, and SEMG is used to monitor muscle activity in real-time, ensuring that patients are working within safe and effective limits. By integrating game-like interfaces and customized training regimens, these portable devices provide a user-friendly approach to neuro rehabilitation that can be used in rehabilitation centers, hospitals, or even at home. These devices aim to significantly improve rehabilitation outcomes by targeting both the neurological and muscular aspects of recovery.</p>
