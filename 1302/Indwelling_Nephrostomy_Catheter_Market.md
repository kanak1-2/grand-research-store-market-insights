 <p>Indwelling nephrostomy catheters are medical devices used for draining urine directly from the kidneys when there is a blockage in the ureter. These devices create an artificial opening between the kidney and the skin, allowing urine to bypass the obstructed ureter and be drained into a collection bag. Nephrostomy procedures are commonly required in cases of renal calculi (kidney stones), congenital conditions, tumors, or other complications that hinder the normal flow of urine into the bladder. The insertion of a nephrostomy catheter is done through a percutaneous procedure, which involves minimal incisions and provides significant advantages over traditional surgical methods. These advantages include reduced hospital stay, smaller incisions, and shorter recovery times.</p>
