<h1>Neurological Disorder Diagnostics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Neurological disorder diagnostic tools are essential instruments used for diagnosing a variety of neurological conditions. These disorders, which affect the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system, include diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson???s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other neurological impairments. Diagnostic tools help identify the presence, severity, and type of neurological disorder, enabling timely treatment and management. These tools range from imaging techniques like MRI, CT scans, and PET scans, to in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tools, such as blood tests and genetic analysis. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for managing symptoms, predicting disease progression, and formulating effective treatment plans.</p>
