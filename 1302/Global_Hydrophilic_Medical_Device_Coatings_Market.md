 <p><strong>Hydrophilic Medical Device Coatings</strong>: Special coatings applied to medical devices to enhance their interaction with water, making the surface more water-attracting (hydrophilic). These coatings are designed to improve biocompatibility, reduce friction, and enhance the comfort and performance of devices such as catheters, stents, and surgical instruments. By creating a slippery, water-absorbing layer, hydrophilic coatings can help reduce tissue irritation, prevent infections, and facilitate smoother insertion and removal of medical devices. The coatings are often made from polymers that retain water, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), ensuring a lubricated surface that is gentle on bodily tissues.</p>
