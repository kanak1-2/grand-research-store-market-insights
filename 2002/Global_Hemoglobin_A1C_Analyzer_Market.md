<h1>Global Hemoglobin A1C Analyzer Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p><strong>Report Overview:</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Hemoglobin is a protein found in the red blood cells. Its job is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all other parts of the body. Hemoglobin also has the ability to bind with glucose in the bloodstream; this type of bonding is called glycation.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The glycation process is irreversible so glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) remains in its evolved state for the lifespan of the red blood cell - approximately 8-12 weeks. By measuring the amount of HbA1c in the blood it is possible to determine average blood glucose control over an 8-12 week period. The more HbA1c in your blood, the less controlled a patients diabetes is and the more susceptible they are to developing long-term health complications.</p>
