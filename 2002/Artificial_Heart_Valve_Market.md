 <p>Artificial heart valves are medical devices designed to replace damaged or diseased natural heart valves, restoring normal blood flow and improving cardiac function. Several factors are driving the growth of the artificial heart valve market. Firstly, the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as valvular heart disease, is contributing to the rising demand for artificial heart valves. The aging population, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy dietary habits have led to a higher incidence of heart valve disorders, creating a significant patient population in need of valve replacement. Secondly, technological advancements in heart valve technologies have significantly improved the performance and durability of artificial valves. The development of bioprosthetic valves, mechanical valves, and transcatheter heart valves has enhanced treatment options and provided better outcomes for patients. These advancements have also led to the minimally invasive implantation of heart valves, reducing the risks associated with traditional open-heart surgeries.</p>
