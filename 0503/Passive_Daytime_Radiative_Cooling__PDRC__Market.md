<h1>Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling (PDRC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling (PDRC) is an innovative cooling technology that enables surfaces to stay cooler than their surroundings under direct sunlight without consuming energy. This is achieved by designing materials that reflect most of the sunlight while simultaneously emitting infrared radiation through the atmospheric window (8-13 micrometers) into outer space, which effectively radiates heat away. PDRC materials often have a high solar reflectance and high thermal emittance, making them ideal for applications such as building roofs, walls, and outdoor equipment. By passively cooling surfaces, PDRC can reduce the need for air conditioning, lower energy consumption, and mitigate urban heat island effects, contributing to energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.</p>
