<h1>Global Hemp Beer Market Research Report 2025(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Hemp beer is a unique category of craft beer infused with elements of the cannabis plant. Unlike traditional brewing, which relies solely on grains, hemp beer incorporates hemp seeds, oils, or extracts to introduce distinct flavors and aromatic profiles. Importantly, hemp beer does not contain THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive compound in cannabis, ensuring legal compliance in most markets. However, some variants incorporate CBD (cannabidiol), a non-psychoactive component believed to offer relaxation benefits.</p>
