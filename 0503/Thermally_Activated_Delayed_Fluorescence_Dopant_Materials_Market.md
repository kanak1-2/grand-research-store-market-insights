<h1>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dopant Materials Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have great application prospects in flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting. As the third-generation OLEDs, TADF materials have a maximum exciton utilization rate of 100%, which has attracted extensive attention in the industry. At present, TADF-based OLEDs have achieved high external quantum efficiency, but like phosphorescent OLEDs, most of the TADF molecules need to be doped in the host material.</p>
