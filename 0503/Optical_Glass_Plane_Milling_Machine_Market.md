 <p>Optical glass plane milling machine is a finishing processing equipment specially used for optical glass plane processing. Optical glass is a glass material with specific optical properties, which is widely used in optical instruments, photographic equipment, eyeglass lenses and other fields. The optical glass plane milling machine uses a combination of milling and grinding to perform plane processing on optical glass. Milling is mainly used to remove material, while grinding is used to improve surface finish and precision. During the processing, the optical glass surface milling machine uses specific technology and processes to achieve spark-free grinding to protect the optical glass from thermal damage.</p>
