 <p>Nano 3D printing technology can produce high-precision parts with dimensions less than 100 nanometers. In terms of size, nano 3D printing and micron-level 3D printing are both micro 3D printing technologies. Unlike ultra-large-scale 3D printing technology, micro-3D printing (microns are a thousand times larger than nanometers, but still only one-thousandth of a millimeter) is the other extreme</p>
