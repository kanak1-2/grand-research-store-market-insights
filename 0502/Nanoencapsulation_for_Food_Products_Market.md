<h1>Nanoencapsulation for Food Products Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Nanoencapsulation is an advanced technology used to package nanoparticles of gas, liquid, or solid substances within a secondary material. The core material, also known as the active ingredient, can include bioactive compounds such as vitamins, drugs, biocides, and flavoring agents. The shell material, which can be composed of lipids, proteins, or polysaccharides, serves to protect the core from environmental degradation and control its release. In the food industry, nanoencapsulation enhances the stability, bioavailability, and controlled delivery of ingredients, thereby improving product quality and shelf life.</p>
