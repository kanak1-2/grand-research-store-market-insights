<h1>Pre-assembled Nanodisc Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Pre-assembled nanodiscs are small, disc-shaped structures ranging from 7 to 50 nanometers in diameter. These nanodiscs consist of a phospholipid bilayer stabilized by membrane scaffold proteins (MSP) or synthetic polymers. Due to their structural and functional properties, nanodiscs are widely utilized in proteomics and biomedicine, offering a versatile platform for studying membrane proteins, drug delivery, and therapeutic applications. By providing a near-native lipid environment, nanodiscs are particularly suited for the structural and functional analysis of integral membrane proteins and their interactions.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global pre-assembled nanodisc market size was valued at approximately USD 201 million in 2024 and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.60%, reaching USD 328.22 million by 2032. </strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>This growth is driven by increasing applications in drug development, disease research, and structural biology. Historical trends indicate consistent demand due to advancements in proteomics and biotechnology.</p>
