<h1>Multilayer Zirconia Blocks Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Multilayer zirconia blocks are advanced dental ceramics composed of multiple layers of zirconia, each featuring a different shade and translucency. This layered structure allows for the fabrication of natural-looking dental restorations, closely mimicking the color gradient and translucency of real teeth. These blocks are primarily manufactured using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. The process begins with scanning a patient&#39;s teeth to create a digital model, which is then used to design the restoration. Once the design is finalized, it is milled from a multilayer zirconia block, ensuring precision and efficiency in dental applications.</p>
