<h1>Multilayer Co-extruded Barrier Film Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Multi-layer co-extruded barrier film refers to a functional composite film obtained by extruding melts of resins with high barrier properties and other resins through a common die using multiple extruders. Multilayer co-extruded barrier films have certain gas barrier properties. Barrier property refers to the shielding ability of plastic products (containers, films) to small molecule gases and odors. General-purpose plastics such as PE and PP have higher gas transmission rates, while PA, PVDC, EVOH and other resin materials have much lower gas transmission rates than general-purpose plastics, and have better barrier properties. Therefore, we usually refer to multi-layer co-extruded films containing at least one resin material among PA, PVDC and EVOH as multi-layer co-extruded barrier films.</p>
