 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Oligo synthesis, also known as oligonucleotide synthesis, is a laboratory technique used to chemically synthesize short sequences of nucleic acids, typically DNA or RNA oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides are composed of relatively short chains of nucleotides, usually less than 100 bases in length. Oligos (or oligonucleotides) are commonly used as primers in PCR (polymerase chain reactions) to selectively amplify target DNA sequences. They can be tagged with fluorescent dyes or radioisotopes for detection purposes. Oligos are often used in DNA sequencing, gene synthesis, and genetic testing, and can be modified for gene therapies or gene expression.</p>
