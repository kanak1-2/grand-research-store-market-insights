Additionally, it is commonly found in medications for headache relief, as caffeine can help alleviate pain by narrowing the blood vessels.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Natural Anhydrous Caffeine market was valued at approximately USD 42 million in 2024. It is projected to expand at a robust compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 6.70%, reaching an estimated value of USD 75.29 million by 2032.
