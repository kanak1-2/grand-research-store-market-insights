<h1>Non-metal Laser Engraving Machine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Non-metal laser engraving machine is an engraving machine using CO2 laser technology, CO2 laser is very suitable for engraving organic materials, such as paper packaging, plastic products, label paper, leather fabric, glass ceramic, resin plastic, bamboo and wood products, PCB board, etc. Unlike traditional systems, non-metallic laser engraving machine processing efficiency, 10 to 15 times higher than manual engraving plate, high precision, low cost, good printing effect, laser engraving without contact can be product identification, so no maintenance or consumables. CO2 laser engraving machine principle is: CO2 laser beam through the optical mechanism transmission and focus on the surface of the material, high energy density of the laser beam action point of the material quickly vaporization, the formation of crater point, complete engraving.</p>
