<h1>Nerve Hooks Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>The global Nerve Hooks market pertains to specialized surgical instruments used by neurosurgeons to retract, hold, and mobilize nerves and other minute structures, particularly during complex spinal and neurosurgical surgeries. These tools are essential for enhancing surgical precision, ensuring minimal damage to sensitive nerve tissues, and promoting successful recovery post-operation. Nerve hooks are designed to allow surgeons to access hard-to-reach areas while preserving nerve integrity, making them vital in neurosurgery, particularly during delicate spinal procedures.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Nerve Hooks market was valued at approximately USD 71 million in 2024. Over the forecast period, it is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.10%, reaching USD 93.45 million by 2032.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>This steady growth reflects the increasing demand for advanced surgical tools that ensure higher precision in neurosurgeries. As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurological disorders is rising, driving the demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures and sophisticated instruments like nerve hooks.</p>
