<h1>Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The global Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators market focuses on ventilatory devices specifically designed to provide respiratory support for preterm and critically ill infants. These devices cater to neonates suffering from respiratory failure, characterized by low lung compliance, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators operate by delivering a set pressure to ensure consistent ventilation, thereby aiding in effective respiratory management.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>These ventilators are indispensable in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), ensuring that infants with underdeveloped or compromised lungs receive adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This market encompasses various ventilator types, from invasive to non-invasive, and spans applications in hospitals and specialized medical centers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators market was valued at USD 43 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 63.90 million by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.50% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by advancements in neonatal care, an increasing number of preterm births, and rising healthcare expenditure globally.</strong></p>
