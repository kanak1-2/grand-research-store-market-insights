<h1>Neonatal Phototherapy Equipment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Neonatal phototherapy devices are specialized medical equipment designed to treat neonatal jaundice, a common condition affecting newborns characterized by elevated bilirubin levels. If left untreated, neonatal jaundice can progress to severe hyperbilirubinemia, potentially leading to neurological damage or death. These devices utilize light therapy to break down excess bilirubin in the blood, facilitating its excretion and preventing complications. The equipment is categorized by type and application, making it adaptable for various clinical and home settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Neonatal Phototherapy Equipment market was valued at approximately USD 217 million in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 328.08 million by 2032, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.70% during the forecast period. Historical trends reveal steady growth driven by rising awareness about neonatal health and advancements in medical technologies.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Regionally, the North American market size was estimated at USD 61.19 million in 2024, with a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.03% expected from 2025 to 2032. Europe, Asia-Pacific, and emerging markets in South America and Africa also contribute significantly to the overall market. The increasing prevalence of neonatal jaundice, coupled with technological advancements, continues to drive the expansion of this sector.</strong></p>
