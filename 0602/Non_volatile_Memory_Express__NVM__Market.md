<h1>Non-volatile Memory Express (NVM) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a logical device interface specification designed specifically for non-volatile storage media, such as solid-state drives (SSDs). Unlike traditional storage protocols like SATA or SAS, NVMe leverages the high-speed PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) bus to deliver unmatched performance. With its ability to support deep parallelism through queues, NVMe can manage up to 64,000 commands in a single queue and handle 64,000 queues simultaneously. This results in significantly reduced latency, higher input/output operations per second (IOPS), and improved energy efficiency, making it a game-changer in the storage industry.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">The global Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) market is experiencing unprecedented growth. In 2023, the market size was estimated at USD 18,060 million and is projected to reach USD 68,150.44 million by 2032, representing a robust compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 15.90% during the forecast period. </span></strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">North America accounted for a significant share, with a regional market size of <strong>USD 6,076.03 million</strong> in 2023 and a projected <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>13.63%</strong> from 2025 to 2032.</span></p>
