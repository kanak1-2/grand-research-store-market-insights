<h1>Non-lubricated Plug Valves Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Non-lubricated plug valves are a type of valve that is used to control the flow of liquids and gases in pipelines, specifically in lower-pressure systems. Unlike lubricated plug valves, non-lubricated versions do not require any lubricant to operate, making them suitable for applications where lubrication is not necessary or would be a hindrance. These valves feature a tapered or cylindrical plug that can be rotated inside the valve body to regulate the flow of fluids. The plug is typically made from durable materials such as stainless steel, and it is designed to handle media such as water, gas, and even certain chemicals, depending on the material used.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>These valves are commonly employed in industries such as water treatment, petroleum and natural gas, and chemical processing, where the absence of lubrication can prevent contamination or operational inefficiencies. Non-lubricated plug valves are particularly useful for applications in lower pressure lines, although their valve seats may degrade more quickly from dust, dirt, and other debris compared to their lubricated counterparts.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Non-lubricated Plug Valves market was valued at approximately USD 898.40 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 1267.8? million by 2032. This represents a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.40% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.</strong></p>
