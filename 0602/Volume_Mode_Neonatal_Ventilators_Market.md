<h1>Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators are specialized medical devices designed to provide ventilatory support to preterm and critically ill infants suffering from respiratory failure. These devices deliver a preset tidal volume to ensure consistent lung ventilation despite variations in airway resistance or compliance. This precision makes them essential for neonates with low-compliance lungs, small tidal volumes, high airway resistance, and elevated respiratory rates. These ventilators are pivotal in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), helping to stabilize the breathing patterns of vulnerable infants while minimizing potential lung damage.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators market was valued at USD 76 million in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 112.94 million by 2032, registering a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.50% during the forecast period.</strong></p>
