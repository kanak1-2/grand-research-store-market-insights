<h1>Neonatal Light Therapy Device Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Neonatal Light Therapy Devices</strong> are specialized medical devices used to treat neonatal jaundice, a common condition in newborns caused by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood. These devices expose newborns to specific wavelengths of light to break down excess bilirubin, which is then eliminated from the body. The devices typically use polychromatic polarized light, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps, or full-spectrum light to achieve therapeutic effects. The two primary types of neonatal light therapy devices are phototherapy lamps and phototherapy blankets.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Neonatal Light Therapy Device market was valued at USD 102.30 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 145.60 million by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.00% during the forecast period.</strong></p>
