<h1>Non-Isolated LED Driver Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Non-Isolated LED Drivers are electrical devices that directly connect the load terminal to the input terminal without using a transformer to step down the voltage. These drivers allow the high voltage from the alternating current (AC) source to be supplied directly to the load terminal, ensuring efficient operation and compact design. Non-isolated drivers are frequently used in applications requiring cost-effective and space-saving solutions, such as commercial LED lighting and home appliances.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global Non-Isolated LED Driver market was valued at USD 4,536 million in 2023 and is projected to grow significantly to USD 24,116.34 million by 2032, reflecting an impressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 20.40% over the forecast period.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>North America???s Non-Isolated LED Driver market was estimated at USD 1,631.44 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 17.49% from 2025 to 2032. This regional growth is fueled by increasing demand for energy-efficient lighting solutions and advancements in LED technology.</p>
